Implementation of the thought experiment known as Newton's cannon. Newton imagined a giant cannon capable of firing cannonballs at any velocity. If the cannonball is fired at a normal speed it will travel on an arc and fall to the Earth. Increasing the cannonball's speed will increase the distance traveled and widen the arc. With enough speed the cannonball's downward motion, caused by the pull of gravity, will be matched by the curvature of the Earth. 

This is a demonstration that allows you visualize and experiment with this concept.  

A unity project, version 4.6b. 

Most of the code is in Canon.cs and SatelliteController.cs.
